    "content": "Lately, I’ve been exploring how AI might evolve beyond just tools or services—and instead become embedded agents in a decentralized, peer-to-peer social system. Imagine a world where your data doesn’t live on a company’s server but is distributed across personal devices, encrypted, and relayed like packets in a global, self-healing mesh. A world where your interactions with others don’t pass through a platform, but are routed and filtered by the AIs you trust—your own.\n\nIn this future, every person has a local LLM—an intelligent layer that filters, stores, interprets, and even responds on your behalf. You control it. It learns from your data, your rhythm, your emotional tone. But it doesn’t exist in isolation.\n\nAround you, shared or emergent LLMs begin to form. Some are local—representing a city, a neighborhood, a subculture. Others are global, trained on permissioned or public content from many nodes. You decide how much to interact with these emergent intelligences. You might query the local arts LLM for nearby shows, contribute memes to a collective humor agent, or fork a regional model to tune it for your values.\n\nThis isn’t just decentralized storage. It’s decentralized intelligence. Each device can act as a relay, a host, a thinker. Data can live near where it’s relevant—redundantly and securely—spreading like culture does. Popular content (memes, moments, declarations) could propagate based on emergent memetic weight, not global algorithmic force.\n\nAnd yes, the site you’re on now is still just a simple preview. It’s not peer-to-peer yet, but it's moving in that direction. A site that responds to your touch, rewrites itself as you explore, and evolves based on your rhythms. That’s the spirit I want to carry forward—not just for one site, but for how we might inhabit the web itself.\n\nWe don't need one AI to rule them all. We need many, shaped by us, in constant conversation.",

    "content": "Sometimes conversation just flows—everyone’s on the same page, sharing ideas without awkward pauses. Other times, it feels clunky or forced, like you’re speaking different languages. My friends and I call that harmonious state Rhythm Theory: people syncing so tightly that a single word can carry an entire conversation or launch it somewhere new.\n\nWe’ve all felt this in different forms, whether dancing at concerts, performing in an orchestra, or bonding over a shared activity. There’s a technical term—“joint action”—for what happens when folks synchronize their movements or thoughts in real time. Scientists also talk about “entrainment,” the process by which groups line up their rhythms. But I first grasped it intuitively: at certain concerts, our small crew would be the only ones dancing, yet the DJ’s energy and each other’s company made us feel connected. We were entraining to that beat and to each other. Even naming it—“Rhythm Theory”—could both capture and disrupt the magic.\n\nThe science behind it is fascinating. Parts of our brains mirror each other’s actions, bridging self and other. It’s how we can empathize, predict a friend’s next move, or anticipate a partner’s chord change in a jam session. This synchronization can resonate in our brain waves and shape how we respond to each other moment by moment.\n\nBut more than a neat neuroscience fact, Rhythm Theory is something I try to bring into daily life. It’s about intention—making small efforts to tune into what others really mean, how they might feel, and how you’re coming across. That might mean adjusting how you phrase something, listening more actively, or reading the cues beneath someone’s words. Even a bit of awareness can spark a deeper connection and bring you closer to that rhythm we all crave.\n\nNo one can be in perfect sync all the time, of course. We each have our own patterns, personalities, and contexts. But I’ve found that recognizing this dynamic—knowing we can intentionally create flow—makes a big difference. Planning group activities around shared interests or simply acknowledging that we want to communicate better can set the tone. My friends and I have discovered that these conversations about conversation (“meta-communication”) can be a surprisingly powerful way to strengthen our bonds.\n\nUltimately, the best part of Rhythm Theory is that it celebrates the moment. It’s not about forcing some grand harmony; it’s about noticing those small micro-adjustments that bring us into sync. When I talk about evolving online platforms, personal AIs, or decentralized webs of shared knowledge, I see parallels in how we humans naturally “entrain” with one another. We’re wired for rhythm—in music, language, and ideas.\n\nSo whether you’re building AI-driven experiences, forging new forms of social interaction, or just trying to hold a more meaningful conversation, Rhythm Theory underscores one essential truth: the future may be built on advanced technology, but it’s still powered by the deeply human need to connect. And at the heart of connection is the flow that makes us feel in tune—the subtle magic we’ve always recognized, even before there was a name for it.",

By pairing it with HTMX—especially the WebSocket extension—I can achieve a reactive, dynamic experience without juggling multiple frameworks or heavy client-side code.\n\nThe HTMX WebSocket extension simplifies how the server and browser talk. When you click or hover on words, HTMX sends that data to the Go server, which interacts with OpenAI using function calling. The server then returns updated content that HTMX seamlessly swaps in, all in real time. For a project of this scale, server rendering remains efficient and easy to maintain.\n\nThe elegance comes from keeping most logic in Go, a language I’m comfortable with, while letting HTMX handle UI events and partial updates. It means fewer moving parts—no separate front-end framework required—and a smoother integration of AI features.",

Instead, they’ll morph in real time, powered by AI that tailors text, images, and even functionality based on who’s browsing or which triggers occur. As the volume of AI-generated material skyrockets, people will likely rely on personal AIs that can filter and transform the endless content swirl into something curated and meaningful for each individual.\n\nThis site is a small glimpse of that future: an evolving set of text blocks that shift based on user interaction. In the long run, I envision robust, domain-specific AIs shaping entire sites for each visitor—filling them with dynamic, context-aware content. We’ll need new patterns, both social and technical, to manage these AI-driven experiences. I’m excited to keep exploring those possibilities!",
