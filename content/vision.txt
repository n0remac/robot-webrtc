I believe we’re entering an era where websites are no longer static or updated periodically by hand. Instead, they’ll morph in real time, powered by AI that tailors text, images, and even functionality based on who’s browsing or which triggers occur. As the volume of AI-generated material skyrockets, people will likely rely on personal AIs that can filter and transform the endless content swirl into something curated and meaningful for each individual.

This site is a small glimpse of that future: an evolving set of text blocks that shift based on user interaction. In the long run, I envision robust, domain-specific AIs shaping entire sites for each visitor—filling them with dynamic, context-aware content. We’ll need new patterns, both social and technical, to manage these AI-driven experiences. I’m excited to keep exploring those possibilities!
